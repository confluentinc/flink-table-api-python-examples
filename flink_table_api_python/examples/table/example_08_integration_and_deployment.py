# An example that illustrates how to embed a table program into a CI/CD
# pipeline for continuous testing and rollout.
#
# Because we cannot rely on production data in this example, the program sets
# up some Kafka-backed tables with data during the {@code setup} phase.
#
# Afterward, the program can operate in two modes: one for integration testing
# (test phase) and one for deployment (deploy phase).
#
# A CI/CD workflow could execute the following:
#
#     poetry run example_08_integration_and_deployment setup
#     poetry run example_08_integration_and_deployment test
#     poetry run example_08_integration_and_deployment deploy
#
# NOTE: The example submits an unbounded background statement. Make sure
# to stop the statement in the Web UI afterward to clean up resources.
#
# The complete CI/CD workflow performs the following steps:
#   - Create Kafka table 'ProductsMock' and 'VendorsPerBrand'.
#   - Fill Kafka table 'ProductsMock' with data from marketplace examples table
#     'products'.
#   - Test the given SQL on a subset of data in 'ProductsMock' with the help of
#     dynamic options.
#   - Deploy an unbounded version of the tested SQL that write into
#     'VendorsPerBrand'.
